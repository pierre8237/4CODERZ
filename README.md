We used an Agile methodolgy to bring your concept to deployment in three weeks. Dionysis is a winepairing app that gives users information about a selection of wines from around the world, including suggestions for cheeses to pair them with.

To install necessary dependencies, run the following command:

CD to the server-side package.json file and open a terminal. Type npm install to download the correct dependencies and modules. Once that is complete type npm run start to initiate the development server.

Your app should now be running on <http://localhost:3000>. The Express server should intercept any AJAX requests from the client.
